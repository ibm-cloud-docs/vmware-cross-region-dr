# Architecture decisions for compute
{: #compute-decisions}

The following are compute architecture decisions for the VMware Disaster Recovery with Veeam pattern.

| **Architecture decision**                            | **Requirement**                                                     | **Options**                                                                                     | **Decision**                                      | **Rationale**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

| Veeam all-in-one solution deployment site            | Select the most appropriate deployment site to maximize performance | Protected site, recovery site                                                                   | **Recovery site**                                 | The location of the Veeam Backup and Replication server for replication scenarios is not based on performance but on availability for recovery. By placing the Veeam Backup and Replication server at the recovery site means that it is available to recover when needed, therefore, lowering the recovery time objective. |
| Veeam solution deployment type on the recovery site  | Provide an all-in-one automated Veeam deployment                    | {{site.data.keyword.baremetal_long}} VSI Virtual machine (VM) hosted on the VMware environment                             | Virtual machine                                   | Use ESX DRS and HA, hence the logical sense to use VMware VM as a hosting environment                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

No all-in-one deployment | No all-in-one deployment (Veeam Proxies)   | Veeam best practice for replication is to replace the Veeam Backup and replication server at the recovery site.                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

Veeam advise when using virtual machine proxies and NFS v3 or vSAN to use a proxy per host and use VM-Host affinity rules.                                                                             |

These architecture decisions are addressing pure disaster recovery use case scenarios. For backup use cases the deployment requirements can be different, such as have a separate dedicated Veeam backup environment. This pattern donâ€™t address the backup design and solution aspect
