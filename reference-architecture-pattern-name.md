# VMware Disaster Recovery on IBM Cloud using Veeam.

{: \#vmware-cross-region-dr} {: toc-content-type="reference-architecture"} {: toc-version="1.0"}

Reference architecture using Veeam for a DR solution for VMware workloads at source and target locations.

- Supported by delivery and orderable via Cloud Catalog with near real-time RPO, RTO.
- Protected workloads in DR zone must support Data Encryption. GPDR and other regulated markets requires PI/SPI data to be protected according to the laws.

Here is the Architecture overview

Key Components of Veeam on IBM Cloud

1. **IBM Cloud Infrastructure:**

* VMware-based virtualized environment hosted on IBM Cloud.
* Multiple ESXi hosts forming a cluster for running virtual machines.

2. **Veeam Backup & Replication Server:**
   * Deployed within the VMware environment as a virtual machine.
   * Responsible for managing backup and replication jobs.
3. **Veeam Backup Repository:**
   * A dedicated storage location for storing backup files.
   * Can be implemented as an IBM Cloud Object Storage or a high-performance block storage solution.
4. **Veeam Backup Proxy:**
   * Installed on a separate virtual machine.
   * Facilitates data transfer between VMware infrastructure and the Veeam Backup & Replication server.
5. **Veeam Backup Console:**
   * Web-based console for configuring and monitoring backup jobs.
   * Accessible from administrators' workstations.
6. **Continuous Data Protection (CDP) Server:**
   * Deployed as a virtual appliance.
   * Ensures real-time replication of VMs for near-zero RPO (Recovery Point Objective).

To adapt/recreate – CDP architecture.

The Veeam solution available from IBM Cloud VMware Solutions catalog is based on Veeam Backup and Replication 12 and Veeam Availability Suite 12.

It enables the backup of VMware workloads as well as their replication between different ESXi hosts/clusters/environments.

## Design scope

{: \#design-scope}

Following the [Architecture Framework](https://test.cloud.ibm.com/docs-draft/architecture-framework?topic=architecture-framework-taxonomy), pattern-name covers design considerations and architecture decisions for the following aspects and domains:

- **Compute:** Bare Metal and Virtual infrastructure
- **Storage:** Primary, Backup, Archive and Migration
- **Networking:** Enterprise Connectivity, Edge Gateways, Segmentation and Isolation, Cloud Native Connectivity and Load Balancing
- **Security:** Data, Identity and Access Management, Infrastructure and Endpoint, Threat Detection and Response
- **Resiliency:** Backup and Restore, Disaster Recovery, High Availability
- **Service Management:** Monitoring, Logging, Alerting, Management/Orchestration

The Architecture Framework, described in [Introduction to the Architecture Framework](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/architecture-framework?topic=architecture-framework-intro), provides a consistent approach to design cloud solutions by addressing requirements across a pre-defined set of aspects and domains, which are technology-agnostic architectural areas that need to be considered for any enterprise solution. It can be used as a guide to make the necessary design and component choices to ensure you have considered applicable requirements for each aspect and domain. After you have identified the applicable requirements and domains that are in scope, you can evaluate and select the best fit for purpose components for your enterprise cloud solution.

The Figure 3 shows the domains that are covered in this solution.
