This pattern covers

*Veeam Disaster Recovery  for customer workloads on IBM Cloud VMware environment*

•	Provide a prescriptive Disaster Recovery solution for VMWare Workloads on IBM Cloud using Veeam.

•	Provide reference architectures for disaster recovery for VMware workloads running on IBM Cloud vCenter Server **(VCS)** deployments with primary and disaster recovery sites in IBM Cloud( **VCS will be replaced with VCF after  reviews**)

<!-- Add any clarifications of what is in scope/out of scope, make sure you address these points in the doc) -->

Following the Architecture Framework, the VMware Disaster Recovery solution using Veeam  covers design considerations and architecture decisions for the following aspects and domains:

<!-- Note to author> <List the aspects and domains covered in this pattern; Here is an example:-->

- Compute: Virtual Servers
- Storage: Primary Storage, Backup Storage
- Networking: Enterprise Connectivity, Segmentation and Isolation, Cloud Native Connectivity, Load Balancing, DNS
- Security: Data Security, Identity and Access Management, Application Security, Infrastructure and Endpoint Security
- Resiliency: High Availability, Backup and Restore
- Service Management: Monitoring, Logging, Auditing, Alerting

The Architecture Framework provides a consistent approach to design cloud solutions by addressing requirements across a set of "aspects" and "domains", which are technology-agnostic architectural areas that need to be considered for any enterprise solution. For more details, see [Introduction to the Architecture Framework](/docs/architecture-framework).
